<h1>Star Clusters from Thesis Research</h1>

<p>The <code>.tar.xz</code> file contains the data of the star clusters I identified and analyzed during my thesis research. This dataset provides comprehensive details on the physical and astrophysical properties of these clusters, along with the methodologies used for detection and classification.</p>

<h2>SLR_catalogue.csv</h2>

<p>This file contains the positions and astrophysical parameters of the star clusters, along with the associated errors. The parameters include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Equatorial coordinates:</strong> Right Ascension and Declination of the cluster</li>
  <li><strong>Parallax:</strong> The distance measurement in arcseconds</li>
  <li><strong>Proper motion:</strong> The apparent motion of the cluster in the sky, measured in milliarcseconds per year</li>
  <li><strong>Cluster radius:</strong> Radius containing 50% of the data and 50% of the cluster's luminosity</li>
  <li><strong>Cluster mass:</strong> Estimated mass of the cluster</li>
  <li><strong>Extinction:</strong> The amount of light absorption by interstellar dust</li>
  <li><strong>Age:</strong> Estimated age of the cluster</li>
  <li><strong>Metallicity:</strong> The abundance of elements heavier than helium</li>
  <li><strong>Distance:</strong> Distance from the Sun to the cluster</li>
  <li><strong>Galactocentric coordinates:</strong> Coordinates relative to the center of the Milky Way</li>
</ul>

<h2>SLR_members.csv</h2>

<p>This file contains the individual members of each star cluster, including their data from the GAIA mission.</p>
