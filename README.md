<h1>Thesis for Astronomy degree</h1>

<p>This repository complements my thesis titled <em>"Identification of Star Clusters in Gaia DR3 to Correlate Them with the Spiral Arms of the Milky Way"</em>. The study focuses on creating a catalog of 534 star clusters using data from Gaia's third Data Release (Gaia DR3). Clustering algorithms such as DBSCAN and pyUPMASK were applied, and isochrone fitting was performed on color-magnitude diagrams to determine key astrophysical parameters, including age, metallicity, distance, and extinction.</p>
<p>The research also explores the correlation between young clusters and the spiral arms of the galaxy, analyzing how their location and chemical composition relate to the galactic structure. This catalog was compared with other prominent works, showing high consistency with catalogs such as those by Cantat-Gaudin et al. (2020) and Hunt & Reffert (2023).</p>
<p>For more details about the methodology or findings, refer to the PDF file in this repository, which provides an in-depth explanation of the process and the significance of the results.</p>

<p>- The <em>Clusters</em> folder contains the final catalog, cluster members, and comparisons with the Hunt & Refert catalog.</p>  
<p>- The <em>Images</em> folder includes various images generated during the analysis of the catalog.</p>  
<p>- The PDF file is the thesis, written in Spanish.</p>
